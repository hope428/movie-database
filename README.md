## Description
This project was made in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It features the OMDB Api. When a user types in a search term, a list of movies including that term is added to the page. The user can see information about those movies. The user can also add the movies to a watchlist that uses localstorage. The watch list is hosted on a separate page.
